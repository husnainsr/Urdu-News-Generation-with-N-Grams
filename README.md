# Urdu News Generation with N-Grams

This project uses N-Grams to generate Urdu news articles. The project utilizes the provided dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle, and uses the News Text column to create N-Gram models.

The project generates five paragraphs of 200 words each, with each paragraph generated using a different N-Gram model, from 1-gram to 5-gram. The first paragraph is generated using unigrams, the second with bigrams, and so on.

This project showcases the power of N-Grams in generating coherent and meaningful text, even in languages with complex grammatical structures like Urdu.
